# Hi there! 👋 I'm javigp2002


## 🚀 About Me

I'm Javier González Peregrín, Master in Computer Engineering at UGR and a passionate developer. I love learning, building, and collaborating on projects that drive technology forward and solve real-world problems. I'm always looking to improve my skills and trying to challenge myself.


I love turning 💡 ideas into real-world software solutions!
One of my proudest achievements is developing and launching a production app for the University of Granada (https://biori.ugr.es), which I built entirely by myself — from initial research and design to deployment and maintenance.
🌟 Key Highlights

    🤝 Excellent communication and collaboration with non-technical stakeholders to understand their needs and deliver user-friendly solutions.

    🧑‍💻 Explored and adopted new technologies from scratch (like Flutter and NestJS) to ensure the app runs on a modern, robust stack.

    🏗️ Applied Clean Architecture and software design patterns for scalable, maintainable, and high-quality code.

    🚀 Managed the full development lifecycle: requirements analysis, UI/UX design, backend & frontend development, deployment, and ongoing support.

I’m passionate about bridging the gap between technology and people, and I enjoy learning new tools and frameworks to bring innovative ideas to life!
